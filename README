 KEIKO 
=======

KEIKO allows to place objects in a 3D space according to a physical model using attraction and
repulsions forces. It has been developped to manage large networks of genes where attraction and 
repulsion are identified to positive and negative correlation between genes observed on a large
panel of transriptomic microarray results. 

This is the final KEIKO version that has been developped by Jerôme Hennetin in 2008 and 
used in the following publication:

Hennetin J, Pehkonen P, Bellis M
Construction and use of gene expression covariation matrix
BMC Bioinformatics (2009) 10: 240
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/10/214

In 2013, the project is carried on with the help of Romain Retureau, to simplify the code 
by eliminating visualisation by Open GL and to add some comments. The aim is to keep a 
simple console application which delivers the final position of object in 3D. The visualisation
will be then provided by another piece of software.
